### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I am a Computer Science student at University of Catania, keen on robotics and artificial intelligence. 
I actively participated in several projects within my University robotics laboratory,
worked along with a team of brilliant developers and engineers
and enhanced my technical and social skills even beyond my primary expectations.
Now I am looking for new exciting challenges to improve and move up.

### What have I done? ðŸ¤–
I have studied microcontrollers firmware development, and their applications in IoT networks and robotics. I participated
in two editions of Eurobot competition with my University team, where we respectively placed in 6th and 5th position.
Our work mainly consists of designing robots capable of solving the tasks we are given from the
competitions and developing one or more strategies in order to let them cooperate and achieve as
many tasks as possible in a limited time.

#### You can take a look at some projects I took part across my Github repositories! ðŸ’»

### What's next?
I am currently look up for a job as a software engineer while studying in order to gain experience and learn as much as possible, especially from working world.
