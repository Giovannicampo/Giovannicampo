### Hi there 👋

#### I am Giovanni, a Computer Science student at University of Catania and developer at [@UniCT-ARSLAB](https://github.com/UniCT-ARSLab) 🤖

### What do I do? 👨🏻‍💻
Despite I am a beginner, I am really interested in open source and contributing. I have taken part in University projects such as Eurobot, an international competition which our University team has been participating for years. My further goals are to start to work and keep studying!

### What can you find here? 🪐
Here are some projects I have done, from robotics to web development, and other nice stuff!
