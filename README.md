### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I am Giovanni, a Computer Science student at University of Catania.

### What do I do?
I am still studying but I am really interested in open source and contributing. I'm filling my profile with projects I have done, mostly about robotics and web development, but I count to broaden my horizons towards other new branches of CS! 

### What can you find here?
Here are some projects I have done, notes and other nice stuff!
